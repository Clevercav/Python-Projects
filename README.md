# Python-Projects
All projects are from Martyr2's mega project list. Link: https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/

I will normally do the bare minimum of these projects, but there might be cases where I go further.

- Text

- [x] Reverse a String (CLI application)

- [x] Pig Latin (CLI application)

- [x] Count Vowels (CLI application)

- [x] Check if Palindrome (CLI application)

- [x] Count Words in a String (GUI application)

# How to run the apps
Using Python 3.6.7

To run an application simply navigate to a project folder and write `python3 "name of project"`
